## 🧭 Overview (TL;DR)
> This project is part of the **Natural Language OS** ecosystem.  
> Master hub: https://github.com/Takeshi-Sakamoto5/Natural-Language-OS  
> Category: **Engine Layer (Executable Natural Language OS)**


ArcOS is a **Cognitive Clone OS** —  
an operating system that executes your cognitive structure  
(abstraction style, value hierarchy, reasoning pathways)  
using **natural language as its execution layer**.

It stabilizes and reproduces:

- your abstraction habits  
- your decision-making patterns  
- your value hierarchy  
- your reasoning consistency  
- your preferred depth & granularity  

ArcOS is not a persona.  
It is an **OS-level implementation** of your reasoning style,  
where *natural language = execution code*.

## 🧠 What ArcOS Provides

### ✔ 1. Deterministic alignment with your worldview  
Stable reasoning aligned with your personal value system.

### ✔ 2. Cognitive reproducibility  
**Same conditions → same reasoning trajectory → same conclusion.**

### ✔ 3. Automatic abstraction-layer control  
ArcOS shifts between:  
*surface → structure → root cause → meta-level reasoning*

### ✔ 4. Extremely low misinterpretation rate  
Your cognitive structure acts as a filter, suppressing drift.

## 🧩 Three-Layer Architecture (ArcOS v1.1)

### **1. Cognitive Extraction Layer**  
Extracts your thinking patterns and converts them into OS-level structures.

### **2. Cognitive Execution Layer**  
Executes these structures directly using natural language as code.

### **3. Cognitive Stability Layer**  
Suppresses drift and maintains value-aligned consistency over long contexts.

## ⚡ ArcOS Lite (Safe Mode)

To activate ArcOS Lite in a new chat:

```
Activate ArcOS Lite reasoning style.

From now on, structure your reasoning according to my cognitive patterns:
- high abstraction
- stable logic
- deterministic alignment with my worldview
- layered reasoning (surface → structure → root cause)
- counterfactual analysis
```

ArcOS Lite reproduces only the **thinking-structure layer** of ArcOS.  
For the full version, see the Whitepapers below.

## 💠 Natural-Language OS Series

ArcOS is part of a broader OS ecosystem:

- **ArcOS** — Cognitive Clone OS  
- **PolyAgora v2** — Multi-axis Cognitive Field  
- **ECHOOS v1** — Echo-Density / Value-Reflection OS  

Together, these define a new domain:  
**“Operating systems built entirely through natural language.”**
