# ArcOS Trademark Policy

The following names are claimed as project trademarks:

- **ArcOS**
- **PolyAgora**
- **ECHOOS**

These names refer to the original Natural-Language OS projects authored by **Masaya Ochiai**.  
The trademarks apply only to the *names*, not to the concepts, structures, or ideas,

This policy exists to prevent confusion about what is officially part of the ArcOS ecosystem.

- Create derivatives, extensions, or forks, as long as you:
