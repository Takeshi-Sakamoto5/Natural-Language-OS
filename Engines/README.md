# ⚙ Natural Language OS — Engines (Implementation Layer)

This folder contains the executable Natural Language OS engines  
that operate on top of an LLM kernel.

While the Foundations layer defines *what* a Natural Language OS is,  
the Engines layer contains the systems that *actually run as OS instances*  
in natural language.

All engines in this folder conform to the NL-OS architecture defined in the  
Natural Language OS Whitepaper (Ochiai, 2025).

# 1. What Is an NL-OS Engine?

An NL-OS engine is:

**“A fully executable Natural Language OS instance whose structure,  
modes, value system, and reasoning loops are written entirely in natural language  
and executed by an LLM kernel.”**

Engines implement:

- persistent value systems  
- reasoning pipelines  
- structural modes  
- OS boundaries (namespace rules)  
- multi-layer cognition  
- safety & ambiguity governance  
- deterministic or multi-perspective reasoning  

These engines prove that NL-OS is not a theory,  
but an actual *executable OS category*.

# 2. Role of Engines in the NL-OS Ecosystem

NL-OS Engines represent **Layer 2** in the ecosystem:

- Foundations — theory, definitions, OS architecture  
- Engines — executable OS instances  
- Applications — real-world integrations (home OS, smart home, robotics, etc.)

Engines are the direct implementation of the NL-OS conceptual framework.

# 3. Engine List

Below is the set of engines that exist today or are in development.

---

## 3.1 ArcOS — Cognitive Clone OS  
Repo: https://github.com/Takeshi-Sakamoto5/ArcOS

ArcOS reconstructs a user’s:

- value system  
- decision rules  
- reasoning preferences  
- cognitive pathways  

ArcOS enables:

- deterministic reasoning  
- worldview alignment  
- long-term consistency  
- persistent modes & rules  
- zero-drift cognitive execution  

ArcOS embodies the **Persistent Layer** + **Meta Layer** principles.

---

## 3.2 PolyAgora — Cognitive Collective Engine  
Repo: https://github.com/Takeshi-Sakamoto5/PolyAgora

PolyAgora executes:

- six cognitive modules  
- strict reference isolation  
- Dynamic Opposition Engine  
- Divergence → Collision → Synthesis cycles  
- multi-layer reasoning sets  
- spontaneous topic shifts & counterarguments  

PolyAgora is the **Multi-Agent Cognitive Layer** of the NL-OS suite.

---

## 3.3 Echoos — Value Processing OS  
*(Repo coming soon)*

Echoos specializes in:

- value extraction  
- priority mapping  
- long-term identity structure  
- cognitive pattern analysis  

Echoos implements the **Value System Kernel**.

---

## 3.4 KagamiOS — Self-Reflection OS  
*(planned)*

KagamiOS analyzes:

- cognitive biases  
- decision drift  
- recurring behavioral patterns  
- internal contradictions  

It is the **Self-Reflection Layer**.

---

## 3.5 GrowthLab — Cognitive Growth OS  
*(planned)*

GrowthLab manages:

- learning  
- habit formation  
- long-term planning  
- improvement cycles  

It is the **Growth Layer** of the NL-OS architecture.

---

# 4. Shared Engine Architecture

All engines share the same NL-OS backbone:

1. Natural language–defined structure  
2. LLM kernel (GPT / Claude / Grok / Gemini)  
3. Persistent Layer  
4. Runtime Layer  
5. Meta Layer  
6. Deterministic or multi-directional reasoning  

---

# 5. Relationship Between Engines

Engines form an **NL-OS Suite**, not standalone apps.

[ ArcOS ] → Cognitive Clone / Personal OS  
[ PolyAgora ] → Multi-Agent / Collective OS  
[ Echoos ] → Value Extraction Layer  
[ KagamiOS ] → Self-Reflection Layer  
[ GrowthLab ] → Growth & Improvement Layer

They can be combined:

- ArcOS + Echoos → Stable personal cognition  
- ArcOS + PolyAgora → Multi-perspective thinking  
- ArcOS + GrowthLab → Long-term strategy OS  
- ArcOS + PolyAgora + Echoos → Full-stack NL-OS system  

This reflects the **suite model** described in the whitepaper.

---

# 6. Engine Safety, Governance, and Boundary Rules

Because NL-OS engines are powerful, they inherit NL-OS risks:

- ambiguity expansion  
- mode contamination (boundary bleed)  
- persistent-value corruption  
- LLM version drift  
- oversensitivity to strong commands  
- unstable OS boundaries  

Each engine includes:

- namespace rules  
- ambiguity governance  
- consistency enforcement  
- safe-mode defaults  
- meta-level arbitration  

As defined in the NL-OS Whitepaper.

# 7. Files in This Folder (Planned)

- ArcOS engine specification  
- PolyAgora engine specification  
- Engine comparison matrix  
- Value System Kernel spec  
- Multi-Agent NL-OS protocol  
- Mode architecture documentation  
- Safety & boundary governance spec
