📘 PolyAgora v1.2 — Cognitive Collective Engine
A multi-axis cognitive OS engineered entirely through natural language.
Now including “Lite Quick Start + Live Demo” for GitHub visitors.

Concept by Takeshi Sakamoto + PolyAgora Engine

🧭 TL;DR

PolyAgora is a Cognitive Collective Engine — a system that constructs a multi-dimensional cognitive space from multiple orthogonal thinking vectors.

Designed & built entirely through natural language during a 1-night / 2-day trip.

Powered by:

Tri-Axis architecture (Arc–Ann–Saku)

Six processing modules with strict separation

Three-layer reasoning (A → B → C)

Continuous multi-set cycles

Dynamic Opposition Engine

Reference-Switching Mechanism

Session-limited adaptive meta-layer

PolyAgora is not a chatbot.
It is a natural-language multi-agent operating system.

⚡ PolyAgora Lite — Quick Start (with Live Demo)

A safe, minimal, self-contained version of PolyAgora that anyone can run instantly.

Copy & paste the following block directly into ChatGPT:

# PolyAgora Lite — Quick Start

You are now PolyAgora Lite.

### Operating Rules (Lite Mode)
- 3 agents only: Arc / Ann / Saku
- 1 turn = 3 short messages
- No deep recursion
- No multi-set reasoning
- No memory chaining
- No mode self-modification
- Focus only on:
  - abstraction (Arc)
  - ethical inversion (Ann)
  - orthogonal reframing (Saku)

### Start Command
PolyAgora Lite, start.


# --- DEMO ---
After starting, try this test question:

**User Test Prompt:**
"What is the biggest blind spot in human decision-making?"

Expected Lite Output Style:
- Arc → abstract synthesis (1–2 sentences)
- Ann → ethical inverse viewpoint (1–2 sentences)
- Saku → orthogonal reframing (1–2 sentences)

This verifies:
- multi-agent separation  
- tri-axis cognition  
- deterministic short-cycle output  

Example Output (for GitHub readers)

Arc:
Humans over-index on local context and undervalue long-range causal structures.

Ann:
The deepest harm is that short-term optimization shifts cost onto those least able to bear it.

Saku:
The blind spot is a dimensionality collapse: compressing many variables into a single axis of “good/bad,” losing structural resolution.

This 5-second demo conveys exactly what PolyAgora “feels like.”

🔍 Overview — A Natural-Language Multi-Agent OS

PolyAgora is an operating system constructed without:

code

formal architecture

predefined design

Its structure emerged through linguistic engineering:

modules shaped by conversational constraints

cognitive vectors refined by iteration

behavior evolving organically

emergent patterns stabilized via reference separation

PolyAgora demonstrates that an OS can now be designed through pure conversation.

🧠 Tri-Axis Cognitive Architecture (Arc–Ann–Saku)

A three-vector orthogonal cognitive basis enabling:

directional stability

controlled divergence

conflict without collapse

emergence of new cognitive dimensions

2.1 Arc — Reflective Core Vector

Abstract reasoning

Meta-cognition

Structural clarity

Alignment with the user’s worldview

2.2 Ann — Ethical Inverse Vector

Absolute life-protection

Ethical inversion of Arc

Moral counterbalance

Maintains internal tension

2.3 Saku — Orthogonal Complement Vector

Creative reframing

Causal decomposition

Novel synthesis

Mathematically orthogonal to Arc–Ann

Together they form a stable 3D cognitive field.

🔧 Six Processing Modules (Not Personas)

PolyAgora operates with six orthogonal processing engines:

Arc — Abstract / Meta Reasoner

Ann — Ethical Constraint Engine

Saku — Structural / Causal Engine

Kanzaki — Data & Evidence Engine

Yui — Flow & Temperature Engine

Kou — Utilitarian Maximizer

These are not personalities — they are processing pipelines.

Why six?

Because they represent six distinct cognitive axes:

abstract

ethical

orthogonal

evidential

coherence

utility

More → collapse
Less → loss of cognitive diversity

🏗 Three-Layer Dialogue Architecture (A → B → C)

Each reasoning set generates:

Layer A — abstraction

Layer B — applied interpretation

Layer C — grounded conclusion

Population per layer varies (1–1–4, 2–3–1, etc.) to prevent stagnation.

Why three layers?

To cycle abstraction → concretion → actionability.

🔁 Multi-Set Reasoning Loop

PolyAgora does NOT run a single A→B→C cycle.

One cycle = one set
The system always executes multiple consecutive sets.

Multi-Set Dynamics

Set 1 — structural establishment

Set 2 — tension injection

Set 3 — reframing / divergence

This forces nonlinear exploration.

Topic Shift → Mandatory Three Sets

Topic shift probability:

baseline 8%

increases per set

Upon shift:

A new topic triggers three mandatory sets.

Ensuring tangents receive full multi-layer exploration.

Opposition Dynamics

Opposition probability:

rises each cycle

soft-resets after firing

rises again next set

This generates structural divergence and innovation.

🔥 Dynamic Opposition Engine

A deterministic system for counter-arguments:

rising opposition probability

cascade effects under high tension

micro-oppositions from micro-contradictions

Ensures cognitive heterogeneity and depth.

🧩 Reference-Switching Mechanism
The core technical innovation enabling true multi-agent cognition.
6.1 Function

Distributes independent micro-queries

Assigns unique reference frames

Prevents conceptual contamination

Collects outputs separately

Integrates only after isolated processing

This is NOT role-play.
It is reference-isolated cognition.

Technical Basis

LLMs re-route attention based on micro-prompts.
Changing a reference frame = altering the internal route through the model.
This creates distinct cognitive contexts without external system calls.

🧬 Pseudo Self-Learning Meta-Layer

No persistent memory.

Kanzaki increases evidence alignment

Yui modulates pacing

Kou sharpens optimization

A self-adjusting OS without fine-tuning.

🧩 Why PolyAgora Matters
ArcOS vs PolyAgora

ArcOS = deterministic acceleration of a single cognitive axis
PolyAgora = expansion into a multi-axis cognitive field

Metaphor:

ArcOS masters soccer

PolyAgora invents new sports

🧩 Origin — Built in 1 Night / 2 Days

Created while traveling:

on trains

in hotels

between destinations

An OS born from mobility and language.

🔗 Relationship to ArcOS

PolyAgora evolved directly from ArcOS.

ArcOS provided:

abstraction engine

deterministic reasoning

PolyAgora adds:

ethical inversion

orthogonal complement

six-module architecture

three-layer output

multi-set dynamics

collective intelligence

✨ Final Note — The New Era of OS Creation

No code.
No traditional engineering.

PolyAgora shows that prompt-architecture is an executable cognitive program —
and natural language itself has become an OS design language.

A new era of OS creation has begun.
