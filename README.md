# 🌐 Natural Language OS — Master Hub

This repository is the **umbrella hub** for the entire Natural Language OS ecosystem created by **Masaya Ochiai**.

Natural Language OS (NL-OS) is a family of operating systems that use **natural language as the primary interface and control layer**:

- As **theory**: “What is a Natural Language OS?” (conceptual & philosophical layer)
- As **engines**: ArcOS, PolyAgora, Echoos, Triagora, etc. (executable OS instances)
- As **applications**: Smart-home OS, home-computer NL-OS, embedded / IoT integrations

This repo does **three things**:

1. Defines the **taxonomy** of Natural Language OS.
2. Serves as a **directory** linking to each engine / project.
3. Acts as the **entry point** for researchers, developers, and future contributors.

## 1. Taxonomy of Natural Language OS

The NL-OS ecosystem is organized into **three layers**:

### 1. Foundations (Conceptual Layer)

> “What is a Natural Language OS?”

- Definitions & core concepts  
- Language-as-OS / language-as-code paradigm  
- OS as a value system (preferences, decision rules, cognitive structure)  
- Theoretical papers and whitepapers (e.g., *What is a Natural Language OS?*)

**Folder (planned):**
- `Foundations/` — specs, theory notes, whitepapers (links to Zenodo etc.)

---

### 2. Engines (Implementation Layer)

> “Concrete OS instances implemented purely in natural language.”

These are **executable Natural Language OS engines** that run on top of LLMs.

- **ArcOS — Cognitive Clone OS**  
  Repository: https://github.com/Takeshi-Sakamoto5/ArcOS  
  - Executes a user’s cognitive structure deterministically at machine speed  
  - Focus: personal value system, zero-drift reasoning, deterministic alignment

- **PolyAgora — Cognitive Collective Engine**  
  Repository: https://github.com/Takeshi-Sakamoto5/PolyAgora  
  - Multi-agent / multi-axis cognitive OS  
  - 6 modules (Arc / Ann / Saku / Kanzaki / Yui / Kou) with strict reference isolation  
  - Tri-Axis architecture and multi-set reasoning cycles

- **Echoos / Triagora / others**  
  (To be added as new engines are released)

**Folder (planned):**
- `Engines/` — high-level specs, diagrams, cross-engine comparisons

---

### 3. Applications (Applied NL-OS Layer)

> “How NL-OS runs on real devices and environments.”

Examples:

- **Home-Computer NL-OS**  
  - NL-OS that runs as a “personal OS” on a home PC  
  - Manages tasks, knowledge, and tools via natural language

- **Smart-Home / Appliance NL-OS**  
  - NL-OS + embedded / edge LLM  
  - Synchronizes with household appliances (AC, lights, washing machine, etc.)  
  - Handles state synchronization, intent synchronization, and goal synchronization

- **Embedded / Robotics NL-OS**  
  - NL-OS as the high-level cognitive layer on devices and robots

**Folder (planned):**
- `Applications/` — design notes, example specs, integration guides

## 2. Repositories in the Ecosystem

### Core Engines

- **ArcOS** — Cognitive Clone Operating System  
  → https://github.com/Takeshi-Sakamoto5/ArcOS-v1.1

- **PolyAgora** — Cognitive Collective Engine  
  → https://github.com/Takeshi-Sakamoto5/PolyAgora  

- **Echoos / Triagora / others**  
  → (To be added)

### Foundations (planned)

- “What is a Natural Language OS?” — theory & definition  
- “NL-OS for Home Computing” — how to install & run NL-OS on a personal computer  
- “NL-OS × Smart-Home & Embedded LLM” — architecture for appliances / IoT

These will be linked here once their Zenodo entries are published.

## 3. How to Navigate This Ecosystem

If you are:

- 🧠 **Researcher**  
  - Start with **Foundations** (NL-OS definitions, theory)  
  - Then read **ArcOS** and **PolyAgora** as concrete engines

- 🧪 **Engineer / Builder**  
  - Start from **ArcOS** and **PolyAgora** repos  
  - Use this hub to understand where each engine fits in the NL-OS taxonomy

- 🏠 **Smart-home / product designer**  
  - Check the **Applications** section  
  - Focus on NL-OS × home computers / appliances / embedded LLMs

---

## 4. Status

- ✅ ArcOS — public
- ✅ PolyAgora — public
- ⏳ Echoos / Triagora — in progress
- ⏳ Foundations papers — drafting
- ⏳ Applications specs — drafting

This repository will serve as the **single source of truth**  
for the structure and evolution of the Natural Language OS ecosystem.
