# What Is a Natural Language OS (NL-OS)?

A **Natural Language OS (NL-OS)** is a new class of operating system whose  
structure, rules, behavior, and value system are written in **natural language**,  
and executed by a **large language model (LLM)** acting as its kernel.

This document serves as the **official GitHub definition** of NL-OS and links to  
the authoritative foundation documents (DOI) that define the architecture,  
conceptual framework, and theoretical basis of the NL-OS ecosystem.

# 🧠 Definition

> **A Natural Language OS is an operating system whose  
> configuration, cognitive structure, and execution pipeline  
> are described in natural language and run directly on an LLM kernel.**

Unlike classical OSes (which rely on compiled code), NL-OS treats:

- **language as code**  
- **LLMs as execution kernels**  
- **cognitive rules as system logic**  
- **value systems as OS settings**  

It is not a prompt.  
It is not a chatbot.  
It is a **true operating system authored in human language**.

# 🔑 Core Principles

## **1. Language-as-Code**
Natural language itself expresses the logic, rules, modes, and internal structure of the OS.  
The LLM interprets and executes the operating system directly from language.

## **2. Externalized Cognition**
An NL-OS acts as an **external cognitive architecture**—  
expressing reasoning patterns, decision criteria, and user value systems.

## **3. LLM Kernel**
The LLM functions as the OS kernel:  
parsing, interpreting, executing, and enforcing the NL-OS structure.

# 🏛 NL-OS Three-Layer Architecture

NL-OS is defined by a formal **three-layer architecture**:

## **1. Persistent Layer**
Long-term configuration of the OS, including:

- value systems  
- decision rules  
- behavioral constraints  
- preference hierarchies  
- mode definitions  
- boundary / namespace rules  

Equivalent to the *file system* of the OS.

---

## **2. Runtime Layer**
Execution state during the active session:

- reasoning  
- short-term state  
- context modeling  
- temporary overrides  
- active cognitive processes  

Equivalent to the *running process* of the OS.

---

## **3. Meta Layer**
A supervisory layer unique to NL-OS:

- arbitration  
- safety  
- boundary isolation  
- ambiguity governance  
- mode contamination prevention  
- multi-OS consistency checks  

Classical OSes do not have this layer.

# 🔧 Relationship to Other NL-OS Engines

NL-OS is the **conceptual and architectural layer** that unifies multiple  
natural-language-defined operating systems, including:

### **ArcOS — Cognitive Clone OS**
Implements a deterministic cognitive structure aligned with a user’s worldview.

### **PolyAgora — Cognitive Collective Engine**
A multi-agent NL-OS composed of six cognitive modules performing  
divergent, conflicting, and integrative reasoning cycles.

### **Echoos — Value Processing OS**
Extracts value systems and constructs stable preference maps.

These engines are **implementations** of the NL-OS design philosophy.

NL-OS = **the definition & architecture**  
ArcOS / PolyAgora / Echoos = **the engines**

# 🏁 Summary

NL-OS establishes a new paradigm:

- **natural language = operating system**  
- **LLM = kernel**  
- **value systems = configuration**  
- **reasoning = execution pipeline**
